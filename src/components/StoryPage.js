                        The air is loaded, sizzling, electrical, my back feathers tingle whenever I
                        come close to this place - and I must be closing in. I hear the screams of
                        the hysteric gulls, what lungs they have (!!) My father always said we were
                        blessed with quietness - almost no voice - so that we instead of talking -
                        listens. We swagger through the crowds of gulls - they all have theories as
                        to why the air here is so different - One gull screams that the air here is
                        loaded due to the dryness and heat of the desert. Another gull, more
                        philosophical but just as loud screams that the air is loaded due to the
                        people who live here, that they fill the air with all their different prayers-
                        Prayers so thick and heavy that you hardly can fly through the air. A younger
                        gull laughs mochingly and screams that it has absolutely nothing to do with
                        all of that. no, it's because of the Nuclear Reactor and the other agro- and
                        petrochemical factories. I'm happy when we finally slip & away from the
                        mob of gulls and I see the hundreds - maybe even more Storks sitting in
                        quitress, in orderly lines on what the gulls would refer to as trash or waste.
                        To me it's a pile of treasure. All the colors in the world, all different
                        materials with a different feel to it and we sit at the very top of all of that!
                        As I come in for the landing I feel how tired I actually am, how hungry! The
                        food here is always surprisingly varied - but you have to be careful. I saw
                        another Stork gulping down a piece of bread with a tiny inside. He didn't
                        scream, but his hissing was horrible and went on all night. Then it stopped.
                        Since then, I always seek through the treasures carefully with my beak
                        before swallowing.
